The running time of counting sort algorithm is linear in terms of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values and so its is mainly suitable for use in situations where the variation of keys is not significantly larger than the number of items, even tough O(n +k) makes counting sort looks like linear sorting algorithm but when the value i.e k is in the order of n^2 or n^3 it makes the time complexity worse, and thus limiting its usage only when certain conditions are met.
