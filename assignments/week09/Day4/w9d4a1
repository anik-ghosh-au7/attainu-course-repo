Consider a machine with 64 MB physical memory and a 32-bit virtual address space. If the page size is 4KB, what is the approximate size of the page table?

assuming that single level of Paging is happening

Number of entries in page table = (virtual address space size)/(page size) = 2^32/2^12 = 2^(32-12) = 2^20

Size of page table = (total number of page table entries) *(size of a page table entry) = = (2^20 *2) = 2MB
